# 🧠 Multilingual Retrieval-Augmented Diabetes Assistant

A multilingual, retrieval-grounded healthcare assistant designed to provide **evidence-based diabetes information** using trusted medical sources and large language models.  
The system focuses on **reducing hallucinations**, supporting **personalized responses**, and enabling **safe, medically grounded AI interactions**.

---

## 📌 Motivation

Diabetes management requires continuous access to reliable, understandable medical guidance. While large language models can generate natural responses, they may produce hallucinated or non-evidence-based medical information.

This project explores how **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** can improve factual reliability by grounding responses in trusted medical guidelines.
